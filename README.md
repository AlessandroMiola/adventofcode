# Solutions to `advent-of-code` puzzles

Personal attempt to solve the `advent-of-code`[^aoc] puzzles in a `TDD` fashion with `python`.

### ⚠️ TODO:
 - Repo setup:
   - 🚧 ~~try out `ruff` as a linter, thus replacing `flake8`~~
   - 🚧 rely on a unique configuration file (possibly `pyproject.toml`)
   - 🚧 add `mypy` (`--strict`?) in the pipeline
   - 🚧 `makefile` | `justfile`
   - 🚧 try out `ruff` as a formatter, thus replacing `black`?
   - 🚧 Dockerization?
   - 🚧 else?
 - Puzzles:
   - 🚧 keep on working on them at my own pace (previous years as well)
   - 🚧 possibly use them as a playground to learn `rust`? (ambitious)


[^aoc]:
    [`advent-of-code`][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
